    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>so what is this? 16:th of April 2016 I wanted to create a github.io page for myself. Maybe a place to add some posts
        regarding thing I work on, maybe some place that I build and forget about as quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        So writing posts... a blogging system? A great opportunity to learn reactJs better! 30 minutes of googling and npm packages
        later and I had a page up and running. The problem? I did understand half of it. There was just loads of "smart"
        crap everywhere. So 20 minutes more of <i>trying it out</i> and then I finaly removed the entire page. Thought,
        ok, maybe not react this time. But this is a great opportunity to dive into Angular 2! 30 minutes later and I had
        a working angular 2 application, great! But loads of complexity and frameworking, and other stuff...
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought to myself, what was it I wanted from the start? What do I <i>really</i> need? Well I need a router. 10
        minutes of googling and nothing that felt <i>just right</i>. So I thought to myself what I great opportunity to,
        build my own router! I should be easy of course, super easy and it should <i>just work</i> so I'm thinking convention
        based. 30 minutes of googling, and trying out hashbang strategy and the history API with pushState and then back
        to hashbang again and then congratulations sir, it's a router!
    </p>
    <p>
        30 minutes more of bugfixing and feature adding (caching is nice!) and it's a better but slightly more complex router...
    </p>
    <p>
        30 minutes more... child view rendering would be nice... so add that... more complexity... crap
    </p>
    <h4>First 4 hours - conclusions</h4>
    <p>
        simplicity is hard, period. (Yes I know there is a period after the word period) building stuff is fun. I learned new stuff
        and that's fun!
    </p>
    <p>Polyfills the way of the web. Turns out that link rel="import" was not supported by Firefox and may never be supported
        by them. So I'm tryingout a <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs">webcomponents polyfill</a>,
        which also includes support for shadow DOM.
