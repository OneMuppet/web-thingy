<div>
    <p>
        So this is a view, in a view in the app-view. There are a number of ways that you can add views. I prefer convention based
        things where the router would expect the html-file to be located in /content/route/route.html. But you can also be
        more specific and specify the full path
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>Convention based view:</div>
        <xmp>
            <view src="about"></view>
        </xmp>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div>Full path:</div>
        <xmp>
            <view src="content/posts/entries/testView1.html"></view>
        </xmp>
    </p>
</div>
