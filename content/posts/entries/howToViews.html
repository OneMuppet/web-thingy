<div>
    So this is a view, in a view in the app-view. There are a number of ways that you can add views. I prefer convention based
    things where the router would expect the html-file to be located in /content/route/route.html. But you can also be more
    specific and specify the full path
    <pre>
        Convention based view:
        <view src="about"></view>
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Full path:
        <view src="content/posts/entries/testView1.html"></view>
    </pre>
</div>
